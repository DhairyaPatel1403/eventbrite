Project Name: EventBrite-Like Event Management System

Project Overview:
EventBrite-like project aims to create a web-based event management system that allows users to host and discover events. It provides features for event creation, event browsing, and participation tracking. The project primarily consists of the following components:

    Database Design:
        Project uses a SQL Server database (named events) to store event-related information. The primary table is named events and stores details about various events.

    User Interface:
        The user interface of this project includes several web pages created using ASP.NET Web Forms.
        Key pages include main.aspx, add.aspx, and confirm.aspx.

    Functionality and Features:

        main.aspx: This page serves as the main dashboard where users can view a list of events, their details, and an option to increment the participant count. Key features include:
            A GridView displaying event details.
            An "Increment Count" button to increase the participant count for each event.
            Textboxes for entering an event key before incrementing the participant count.

        add.aspx: On this page, event organizers can create new events. Features include:
            Textboxes to enter event details, such as event name, organizer, participants, event type, and event key.
            A "Add Event" button to create and save new events to the database.

        confirm.aspx: This page provides confirmation details after incrementing the participant count. Features include:
            Displaying the event name and a link to join the event (the link might be a placeholder URL).

    Data Management:

        Database Schema: The events table in the SQL Server database includes columns for event details, such as event name, organizer, participants, event type, and event key.

        Entity Framework: The Entity Framework is used for data access, enabling interaction with the database from ASP.NET application.

    Styling and Design:
        CSS styles have been applied to improve the visual appeal of web pages. The styles include background colors, fonts, and input element formatting.

Key Concepts:

    Data Handling: This project demonstrates how to handle data using Entity Framework and SQL Server, allowing for the creation, retrieval, and modification of event information.

    User Interaction: Users can browse and participate in events by incrementing participant counts.

    Event Creation: Organizers can create events by providing event details, including an event key for secure interaction.


This project has the potential to be expanded and improved upon, offering a solid foundation for building a feature-rich event management system. It could be used as a local event management tool, and with additional features and security measures, it could be extended to a full-featured Eventbrite-like platform.
